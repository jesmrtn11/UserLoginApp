- **User Login**: Authenticate a user using their username and password.
- **Password Change**: Change the password after verifying the current password.
- **Password Hashing**: Securely store passwords using bcrypt hashing.
- **Input Validation**: Validate usernames and passwords according to specified rules.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20.13.0 or later
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library

## Usage
This application provides an authentication module that can be integrated into other projects or run independently.

# Running the App 
The app uses a JSON file (users.json) in the src/data/ directory to store user data. You can interact with the authentication features through the provided functions in authService.js.

## Running Tests
```bash
    npx jest

## Tests
Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and include:

- User creation with validation
